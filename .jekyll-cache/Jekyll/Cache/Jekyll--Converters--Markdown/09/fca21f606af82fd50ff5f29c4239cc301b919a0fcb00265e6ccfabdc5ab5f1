I"_<p>I’m a builder, experimenter and wearer of many hats. <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dpim">Professionally</a>, I’ve worked on large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and novel blockchain applications. At the same time, I’ve shipped a few <a href="/projects">developer tools and social networks of my own.</a>.</p>

<p>I’m most excited about building tools and multi-party ecosystems that empower others.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m most interested in:</p>
