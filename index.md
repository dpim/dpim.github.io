I'm a builder, experimenter and wearer of many hats. [Professionally](https://linkedin.com/in/dpim), I've worked on large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and novel blockchain applications. At the same time, I've shipped a few [developer tools and social networks of my own.](/projects).

I'm most excited by creating tools and platforms that empower others.

Recent focus areas:
- Platform strategy
- Workflow automation and productivity
- Payments and money movement
