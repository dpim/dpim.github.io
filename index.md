I build products. Professionally, I've worked on large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and novel blockchain applications. At the same time, I've shipped a few [developer tools and social networks of my own.](/projects)

Currently, I'm most interested in:
- Platform strategy
- Workflow automation and productivity
- Payments and money movement
