I love building new products and reimagining what's possible.

[Professionally](https://linkedin.com/in/dpim), I've worked on large-scale developer platforms, productivity software and novel blockchain applications. At the same time, I've shipped a few [developer tools and social networks of my own](/projects)

Recently, I've been most focused on:
- Platform strategy
- Workflow automation and productivity
- Payments and money movement
